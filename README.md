# Loan-Data-Preprocessing

This project focuses solely on the critical initial steps of the data science lifecycle: data cleaning, exploration, and preprocessing. The goal is to transform a raw loan dataset into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format, suitable for subsequent machine learning model.

## Project Overview

Raw data from real-world systems is often messy, inconsistent, and incomplete. This repository documents the entire process of cleaning and preparing a loan dataset for machine learning. The project demonstrates key data wrangling techniques, including handling missing values, standardizing formats, and encoding categorical features, without implementing a predictive model itself.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains several columns related to loan applications. A core part of the process was defining how to handle and interpret these features.

## Methodology and Preprocessing Steps
The data preprocessing pipeline was executed using Python and documented in the main notebook (loan_data_preprocessing.ipynb). The key steps involved were:
Importing libraries
Importing datasets
Missing Values detection and treatment
Outliers detection and treatment
Transformation of Variables
Scaling the Numerical Variables
Encoding the Categorical Variables
Creation of New Variables
Splitting the data into training and test set
